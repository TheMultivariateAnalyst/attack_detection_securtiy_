Detecting False Positives in Identity-Related Security Attacks



This project aimed to develop a proof-of-concept for detecting false positives in identity-related security attacks. The project involved creating a dataset with mixed genuine user activities and simulated identity-related security attacks, preprocessing the data, performing feature engineering, selecting and training suitable machine learning models, and evaluating their performance. The models used were Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and their performance was evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results showed that both models had trade-offs in their performance, and potential improvements were suggested, such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and adding more features to the dataset. The challenges faced in the project included the small dataset size, the current features' limitations, and the possibility of overfitting the models to the training data.
